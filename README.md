This app is no longer live. The ticket selling companies like stubhub, seetgeek, etc do not give out ticket APIs anymore.





This app is essentially expedia for sports ticket sales. We would compare, in real time, the difference in price and section per game selected. You were able to pick your tickets based on price, general location, and specific sections. Then once you have your section you can compare the ticket prices across ALL the different secondary market sellers.
